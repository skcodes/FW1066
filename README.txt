This FW/1 directory is a complete web application and expects to live in its own webroot 
if you plan to run the applications within it. To use it in a separate webroot you can
either copy the org directory to that webroot or add a mapping for /org/corfield to the
corfield folder inside the org directory (or a /org mapping to the org directory directly).
